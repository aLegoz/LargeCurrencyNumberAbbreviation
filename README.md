# Large Currency Number Abbreviation

Mod for [VoxelTycoon game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/732050/Voxel_Tycoon/)

Large currency numbers are represented by adding a suffix, similar to how metric prefixes are used (for example, kilowatts, megawatts, and gigawatts).

Example:
$2 000 = $2 K
$2 500 000 = $2.5 M

Feel free to use the code as you want ❤️
